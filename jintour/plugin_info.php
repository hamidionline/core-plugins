			'change_log'=>'v12 Added image uploading for tour profiles, and modernised how tours are displayed in the booking form, adjusting output so that it is constructed from a template file. Images can only be uploaded for tour profiles that have tours generated after this update due to a table change. v12.1 Fixed a bug in new functionality that would trigger errors in media centre functionality. v12.2 Fixed an issue where the uploaded image for a tour can go missing after the tour is selected in the booking form. v12.3 Restored missing text strings to templates. v12.4 Fixed a notice in the widget. v12.3 French language file added v12.4 template updated to use a definition. v12.5 Lets try that again, shall we? Template updated. v12.6 Fixed a notice. v12.7 Tweaked the cancellation script so that this plugin can be called safely when cancelling bookings automatomagically, specifically for No Show cancellations coming in Jomres v9.21 v12.8 French language file updated.
