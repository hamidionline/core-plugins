	* In two minds about whether or not this should be an api call. On the one hand, it's nice to get a report of all of the user's channels, on the other hand making it an api call which exposes other channels to this one channel breaks the concept of each channel operating in it's own sandbox. Other channels from different suppliers should not know about each other, it's none of their business. For now I'll keep this as it's own query.
