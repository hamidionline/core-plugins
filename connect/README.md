After you connect Jomres will write to the "jomres/configuration.php" file.

Updating these:

'platform_connected' => '1',

'connection_account_id' => 'numbers-goes-here',

When 'platform_connected' => '1', then the "connect" plugin is installed. It is listed under "Third party plugins".

When 'platform_connected' => '0', then you are able to uninstall this plugin under "Third party plugins".

Also, make sure this is what it looks like after you edit this file:

'platform_connected' => '0',

'connection_account_id' => '',

This plugin is ionCube encoded when installed.

I un-encode it and left out the other coding that will disable your site from working without a license key.
