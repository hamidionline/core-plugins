By default Jomres is designed to be a multi-vendor booking platform. Managers who have their own beds24 accounts can import their properties to and from beds24 securely. This setting allows you to override that functionality by having a single api key for all properties. This means that you only need one account with Beds24 however it also means that all charges will be accrued by that one account. Any manager with access to a property will be able to send updates to the property on the beds24 servers. Leave blank to ignore this setting and force property managers to use their own Beds24 accounts. The API key can take any form you want, so long as the key here matches the one in the <a href='https://www.beds24.com/control2.php?pagetype=accountpassword' target='_blank'><em>API Key 1</em> </a> field.  IF YOU ALREADY HAVE AN INSTALLATION OF JOMRES WITH PROPERTIES LINKED TO BEDS24 : You can switch to using this feature, however it would require that you first truncate (empty) these tables, delete the existing properties that are already in Jomres, and that you then re-import the properties from Beds24 into Jomres.
