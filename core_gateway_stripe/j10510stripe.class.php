		// not used atm. Current recommendations are that sites should set minimum deposit to 2x commission rate. If site owners follow that recommendation then there will always be enough funds to pay both Stripe, Site owner, and leaving some left over for the property manager. Without that recommendation, we would need to calculate the entire fees when showing the payment form, and if the deposit isn't enough to then throw an error. Using the 2x guidelines this shouldn't be a problem.
