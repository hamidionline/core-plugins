It is intended for use by developers who have created a lot of development data on their installations (such as test bookings, subscriptions) and want to wipe the information from the system, while maintaining property and tariff information.<br/> The plugin will remove ALL cron logs, user favourites, notes, bookings, invoices, subscribers, subscriptions, guests, audit data, click counts and reviews.");
