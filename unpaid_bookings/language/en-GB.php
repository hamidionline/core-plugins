This is useful when you accept bookings that are paid using offline payment methods (wire transfer, cheque). If a booking is not paid within X number of days from the time when the booking was made, then the booking is deleted or cancelled and the calendar will show the booked dates as available, so somebody else can book those days. When a booking is deleted or cancelled, both you and the guest will receive a notification by email. If you choose to cancel a booking, then the booking and it`s invoice will be marked as cancelled and will not be deleted from the database, so you can access them later. If you choose to delete it, then the booking and it`s invoice will be deleted from the database.");
