This is designed for site managers who're targetting those middle income thirty-somethings who know they want to go on holiday, but don't know where. They only know that they want to spend a few pounds/euros/dollars and they want to do something (e.g. skiing). This plugin gives the visitor an input to enter a pound/euro/dollar/whatever amount and select a feature or features.",

They only know that they want to spend a few pounds/euros/dollars and they want to do something (e.g. skiing). This plugin gives the visitor an input to enter a pound/euro/dollar/whatever amount and select a feature or features. When they click Submit they're taken to a set of search results that will prioritise the results based on the closest number of features it could find that matches the selection, and the system will estimate the number of nights they could stay for the cost they entered. The plugin adds a new link to the Search category of the Jomres main menu called 'lucky dip' once installed but of course you'd probably want to link your own main menu to the 'lucky_dip' task, perhaps from the main page. Alternatively you could use the mambotasaplugin or jomresasamodule to position the initial input.",
