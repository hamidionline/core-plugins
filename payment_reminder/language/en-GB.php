This is useful when you accept bookings that are paid using offline payment methods (wire transfer, cheque). If a booking is not paid within X number of days from the time when the booking was made, then a payment reminder email is sent to the guest. You will also receive a copy of it. If you also use the Provisional Bookings Handling plugin, then make sure the interval at which you want to send the payment reminder email is at least 1 day lower than the one set for deleting or cancelling the unpaid booking.");
